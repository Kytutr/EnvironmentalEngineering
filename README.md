# EnvironmentalEngineering
My various scripts developed during my Environmental Engineering studies.

## Van_Genuchten_curve.plt
This is a Gnuplot script for generating [water retention curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_retention_curve):

## pipes_calculations.r
This R will calculate which HDPE made pipe should be used in water distribution network. Just provide discharge parameter (Q) and get results.
In my calculations I used [Tkachenko and Mileikovskyi (2020) approximation](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-57340-9_37) for [Darcy friction factor formulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darcy_friction_factor_formulae).
For now this script is in Polish, stay tuned and patient for English one.
